# Import Terms

This page allows the import of taxonomy terms along with any attached meta. Currently only the JSON format is supported.

URL: `[SITE URL]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nine3-migrate-page&tab=import-terms`

## Settings

Choose the taxonomy and select (or upload) a JSON import file. Once saved the Run Import button will appear, which you can then click to automatically import the terms.

## Background

This works much in the same way as [Import Posts](import-posts.md). However, because the data is much less dense the process is automated and there isn't a drag and drop interface.
